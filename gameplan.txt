ABSTRACT :
    - summary of main results


INTRO :
- motivation
- talk about bayesian generally and why we want to use over frequentist
- uncertainty
- epistemic
- aleatoric uncertainty
- why bayesian ? (doctor example)
- sampling technique mcmc
- sampling takes long time
- hence bayesian are more computationally demanding
*explain in detail* :
- Talk briefly about frequentist neural nets then contrast with Bayesian neural nets. 
- Why are Bayesian NN so desirable?

RELATED WORK
we could talk about some of the other work that we have referenced, and some of the methods specified in them. ( I recommend the paper bayesian deep learning and a Probabilistic Perspective of Generalization that is uploaded in file exchange, which has a good related work section we can base ours on) 

USING BNN FOR PREDICTION

PROTOTYPE BNN:
- talk about data still
- talk about marginals

ADDING COMPLEXITY
- talk about NN with hidden layer
- include new data set and models.

NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION VIA MONTE CARLO 


STUFF BEN SAID FOR ISP

There was evidence of good numerical experimentation. This project is headed in a good direction. However, the concepts and examples presented were too basic.
On the “Bayesian” slide, the posterior should be P(w|D).  On the “initial model” slide, you should square the terms in the summation.  

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND

cite original sources where possible, not websites and never wikipedia
full bibliographic details (including date of access for web references),

Mark Scheme/100
Depth: 45 marks
Includes depth of mathematical analysis, depth of numerical investigation and selection
of experiments (e.g. including higher dimensional cases not just the simplest problems),
originality, creativity, overall correctness of formulas used, going beyond suggestions from
tutors, logical argumentation and rigor.


Presentation: 35 marks
Includes structure and layout of report, sectioning, abstract/introduction, motivation,
continuity and flow, organisation, clarity of argumentation, use of figures, use of
equations, notational consistency, accuracy of presentation, defining all variables,
coefficients and other terms.


Mechanics: 10 marks
Punctuation, spelling and grammar, correct use of Latex, correct layout of equations,
appropriate font sizes in figure captions and axis labels.


Bibliography: 10 marks
Evidence of own reading, richness/breadth of bibliography, evidence of searching for
original sources, correct citations in text (all entries cited), format of bibliographic entries.
Note: marking of formatting (e.g. figures, equations, references), spelling, and other
mechanical issues will be strict and harsh.
